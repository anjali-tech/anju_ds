## for running this files
### First step compile it 
``g++ L1P1.cpp -o out``

So the syntex goes like first name of the compiler that is 

gcc for c or g++ for c++

then comes the file name that is L1P1 or L1P2 etc etc 

then comes ```-o``` it means output then *out* basically it means that after compilation what will be the name of your file will be most of the time we choose out

### Second step run it 

``./out`` 

Easy it means just run the program or the running compiled file
